<b>How the Web works</b>
<p>
  The web is a cluster of computers communicating with each other. 
  When a person surfs on the the internet, their computer send a request 
  via <em>HTTP</em> protocol to the <em>server</em> and the browser 
  interprets the <em>HTML</em> documents returned from the server and 
  displayed on the screen.
  <br>the following <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/e-48329854/m-48480496">video</a>
  is a good illustraiton of this concept
</p>
<b>HTML</b>
<p>
  <em>HTML</em> stands for <em>Hypertext Markpup Language</em>, forming the majority content of the web.
  <br>HTML has two parts: <em>"text"</em> is the content we see on the web and <em>"markup"</em> is how the text is presented.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Tags and Elements</b>
  <br>HTML documents are composed of HTML <b>elements</b>. 
  While constructing an HTML document, we use HTML <b>tags</b> to tel the browser the type of each elements.
  The basic sturcutre of an elements is <b>start tage - content - close tag </b>.
  However, there are also some tags that do not need a close tag, called the <em><b>void tag.</b></em>
</p>
<p>
  There are two types of elements, the <b>inline tag</b> and the <b>block type</b>.
  <br>The block tag would make an invisible box surrounding its content, like the <b>p</b>tag.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Tags learned from this Lesson</b>
  <br><br>Inline tags:
  <br><b>b tag:</b> make the characters bold
  <br><b>em tag:</b> make the characters italic
